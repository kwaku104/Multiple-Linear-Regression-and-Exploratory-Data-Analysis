# Multiple-Linear-Regression-and-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

Multiple Linear Regression and Exploratory Data Analysis With Scikit-learn &amp; Matplotlib.

In this tutorial I will briefly implement Multiple Linear Regression in Python 3 using at least three functions from Scikit-learn and Matplotlib. Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm where the predicted output is continuous and has a constant slope. Multiple linear regression involves more than two variables 𝑓(𝑥,𝑦,𝑧)=𝑤1𝑥+𝑤2𝑦+𝑤3𝑧 where 𝑤 represents the weights our model will try to learn and 𝑥,𝑦,𝑧 represent the attributes about each observation. I'll use some packages in addition to better explain this tutorial.
